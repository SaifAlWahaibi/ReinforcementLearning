# ReinforcementLearning
Different reinforcement learning algorithm

Comments: -

 - While all the codes were indeed written and contain personal touches by myself, they are influenced by the works of [@philtabor](https://github.com/philtabor) and [@lweitkamp](https://github.com/lweitkamp)
 - All codes are written in PyTorch language
 - While all the codes learn to solve the control problem presented by the chosen environment, in no way are they the ideal solutions. More fine tuning of the hyperparameters is needed.
